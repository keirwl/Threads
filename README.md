#Threads
Threads (code name only, liable to change) is a platform for discussions, with key principles that make it different from forums, Twitter, etc.:

1. The message is more important than identity.
2. The medium should not constrain the message.
3. The message has the right to be forgotten.

There's an increasing expectation that our online lives should be permanently recorded and associated with our offline identities. The egalitarian ideal, that the internet is a place where everyone is equally able to express themselves and their creations, is in reality often hampered by the loudest and most powerful voices silencing minority opinion. Identities lead to egos, egos lead to **us-vs-them** mentalities, prejudice and exclusion.

Threads aims to enable discussions and cultures free from these problems.

1. Anonymous posting is not only allowed but encouraged. Identification will only be allowed as an unpronouncable code on a per-thread basis, to e.g. distinguish the asker of a sensitive question, or an artist providing their content, from imposters.

2. You won't be restricted to 140 characters. Inclusion of text, formatting, images, video and audio content will be allowed so long as they don't interfere with our ability to serve the site, or other users' ability to enjoy it.

3. Threads will not be indexed or archived publicly, and will disappear when they have reached an age limit or have received no new posts in a long time.
